## How does the review system work?
Vokabulo calculates intervals based on your answers. Confident words appear less often; tricky ones show up more until they stick.

## Does it work offline?
Yes. Your progress is cached and syncs automatically once you're back online.

## Can I import my own lists?
Import CSV files or share existing lists with your team. Vokabulo handles duplicates and structure.
