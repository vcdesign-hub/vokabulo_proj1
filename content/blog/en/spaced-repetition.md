Spaced repetition is one of the most powerful techniques for long-term memory retention. But what makes it so effective, and how can you use it to accelerate your vocabulary learning?

## What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. Instead of cramming all at once, you revisit material just as you're about to forget it, strengthening the memory each time.

## The Forgetting Curve

German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget information rapidly after first learning it. His "forgetting curve" shows that without review, we lose about:

- 50% within an hour
- 70% within 24 hours
- 90% within a week

Spaced repetition combats this by scheduling reviews at optimal moments, turning short-term memories into long-term ones.

## How Vokabulo Uses Spaced Repetition

Vokabulo's algorithm adapts to your performance:

- **Words you know well** appear less frequently
- **Challenging words** come back sooner
- **Review timing** adjusts based on your confidence level
- **No wasted effort** on words you've already mastered

## Making it Work for You

To get the most from spaced repetition:

1. **Be consistent** - Daily review sessions, even if short, are more effective than occasional long sessions
2. **Be honest** - Mark words as difficult if you struggle, so the algorithm can help you more
3. **Add context** - Words learned with meaningful examples stick better
4. **Trust the process** - It might feel slow at first, but the long-term results are remarkable

The beauty of spaced repetition is that it works with your brain's natural learning patterns, not against them. Let Vokabulo handle the scheduling while you focus on learning.
