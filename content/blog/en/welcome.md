Welcome to the Vokabulo blog! This is where we'll share thoughts on language learning, vocabulary acquisition, and the journey of building Vokabulo.

## Why We're Building Vokabulo

Most language learning apps follow the same pattern: they teach everyone the same curriculum, in the same order. While this works for foundational grammar and common phrases, it often falls short when your learning needs become specific to your life.

Whether you're:
- Reading a book in your target language
- Preparing for a job interview
- Planning to travel to a specific city
- Learning vocabulary for a hobby or profession

...you need tools that adapt to your actual context, not just generic word lists.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that:

1. **Context matters more than repetition alone** - Words stick when they're tied to real situations and emotions
2. **Your life is the best curriculum** - The vocabulary you need is determined by what you're actually trying to do
3. **AI should enhance, not replace, human learning** - Technology should make it faster to capture and organize vocabulary, but the learning still happens in your brain

## What's Next

We're working on making Vokabulo available across more platforms and adding features that help you:
- Capture vocabulary from books, videos, and real conversations
- Generate situation-specific word lists
- Share vocabulary sets with your learning community
- Track your progress with spaced repetition

Stay tuned for more updates, tips on vocabulary learning, and behind-the-scenes looks at how we're building Vokabulo.

Happy learning! 🚀
