When learning new vocabulary, most people memorize word-for-word translations. 

But this approach misses something crucial: context.

## The Problem with Pure Translation

Imagine learning that "run" in English means "courir" in French. Simple enough, right? But what about:

- "Run a company" (manage)
- "Run out of time" (exhaust)
- "The paint will run" (drip)
- "Run for office" (campaign)

A single translation can't capture all these meanings. 

Words live in context, and that's where their true meaning emerges.

## Learning with Situations

Instead of memorizing isolated words, Vokabulo encourages you to learn vocabulary through situations:

**Traditional approach:**
- Word: "Rechnung"
- Translation: "bill" (or cheque, invoice, receipt...it just depends!)"

**Context-based approach:**
- Situation: At a restaurant
- Phrase: "Kann ich zahlen, bitte?"
- Natural understanding: Asking for the bill/cheque after dinner

The second approach gives you not just a word, but a usable piece of language you can deploy in real life.

## Building Your Mental Library

When you learn words in context:

- **You remember better** - Memories linked to situations are stronger
- **You use them correctly** - You know when and how to apply the word
- **You sound natural** - You pick up the nuances native speakers use
- **You build confidence** - Real situations prepare you for real conversations

## How to Practice Context-Based Learning

1. **Capture words from real situations** - When you encounter a new word, note where you found it
2. **Create personal examples** - Write sentences about your own life using new vocabulary
3. **Use Vokabulo's Situations feature** - Generate word lists for specific scenarios you'll encounter
4. **Think in phrases, not words** - Learn "make a decision" rather than just "decision"

Context isn't just helpful—it's essential. 

The more you connect words to real situations, the more natural and confident your language use becomes.
