Vokabulo is especially helpful if you:

- **already have some foundation** but want to become fluent in real situations,
- **learn best from content** (books, videos, conversations) rather than structured courses,
- **need vocabulary for a specific domain** such as work, travel, hobbies), or
- value structure and progress, but want **learning to revolve around your own interests**.

### Use cases

Vokabulo shines whenever you encounter vocabulary in the wild and want to turn it into something you’ll actually remember.

- **Reading a book or magazine:** Save unfamiliar words with the sentence they appeared in, tag them by chapter or topic, and revisit them later, always in context.
- **Watching a video:** Capture words and phrases as you hear them, preserve tone and meaning, and build collections around a series, a YouTube channel, or a specific topic.
- **Walking a city:** Learn the words you need for signs, menus, transportation, directions, and everyday interactions, exactly when they matter most.
- **Preparing for special situations:** Build focused vocabulary for interviews, technologies, travel, sciences, or any moment where confidence matters.
