A language is about the *words, grammar, pronunciation and culture.*

The culture is the soul of the language, the pronunciation its style, grammar is all about logic (or lack or thereof), and words is the content.

**Once you speak a language reasonably well, the only way to make real progress is to expand your vocabulary.**

Most people, even after many years, will never fully lose their accent (hasta la vista, baby). And when it comes to grammar, either you learned it at school, or you didn’t.

Culture comes naturally through interaction with native speakers.

**But vocabulary, your words, is something you can actively work on and continue to grow for a lifetime.**

Words depend on context. Without understanding the situation in which a word is used, its meaning is often unclear.

**Most language apps teach words without context.** They focus on standardized situations that rarely cover the specific vocabulary you need in real life.

I built this app for myself because I love expanding my vocabulary every day, and because it helps me both at work and in life. 

Even though I’m comfortably trilingual, **I sometimes feel like a beginner when I don’t have the right words for certain situations.**

I wanted an way to quickly jot down a word while reading a book, listening to a podcast, watching a movie on Netflix, or preparing for the very situations where I didn’t have the right vocabulary.

Over the past twenty year, I tested over 50 language apps.

But none came close to the ease of use, intelligence, and user experience I was looking for.

So I started coding while recovering at home after surgery.

That was the beginning of my Vokabulo journey, one I hope to share with people around the world who, like me, enjoy having the right words at the right time.

**There is no greater power than communication.**

One word can make the difference between life and death, success or failure, trust or doubt.

**Vokabulo can help you feel more confident at work, more at home in daily life, and more immersed in the cultures that foreign languages open up.**

I made this for myself.

It would make me very happy if you enjoy it as much as I do.
