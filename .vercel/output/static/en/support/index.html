<p>Why Vokabulo exists, who it helps, and how AI fits into the workflow.</p>
<h3>Why another language app?</h3>
<p>Most language apps try to teach everyone the same curriculum. That works for general progress, but it often fails the moment real life gets specific: your job, your hobbies, your destination, the book you&#39;re reading, or the conversation you actually want to have. Vokabulo exists to close that gap—so you can learn vocabulary that matches your life, not a textbook&#39;s.</p>
<h3>My favorite use cases</h3>
<p>Vokabulo shines whenever you meet vocabulary &quot;in the wild&quot; and want to turn it into something you&#39;ll truly remember.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading a book or magazine:</strong> Save unfamiliar words with the sentence they appeared in, tag them by chapter or topic, and study them later with context.</li>
<li><strong>Watching a video:</strong> Capture phrases you hear, keep the tone and meaning, and build a set around a series, a YouTube channel, or a topic.</li>
<li><strong>Walking a city:</strong> Learn the words you need for signs, menus, transport, directions, and everyday interactions—exactly when they matter.</li>
<li><strong>Preparing for special situations:</strong> Build targeted vocabulary for interviews, appointments, travel, meetings, or any moment where you want to feel confident.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I chose to develop Vokabulo</h3>
<p>Even advanced learners hit awkward &quot;beginner moments.&quot; You may be an expert in one area, but feel stuck in another—because language is not one skill, it&#39;s many contexts. I built Vokabulo to make it easy to collect the right words, keep them organized, and actually retain them through consistent study.</p>
<h3>Who benefits from using Vokabulo?</h3>
<p>Vokabulo is especially helpful if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>already have some foundation but want to become fluent in real situations,</li>
<li>learn best from content (books, videos, conversations) instead of courses,</li>
<li>need vocabulary for a specific domain (work, travel, hobbies), or</li>
<li>like structure and progress, but want it centered around your own interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why AI is a game changer</h3>
<p>AI makes it fast to turn messy input—single words, phrases, or whole sentences—into clean, structured vocabulary with translations and context. Instead of spending time formatting your notes, you spend time learning. It also helps you generate focused vocabulary for situations and topics that would otherwise take hours to compile.</p>
<h3>Platforms</h3>
<p>Vokabulo currently supports iOS on iPhone and iPadOS on iPad. macOS support is in preparation. There&#39;s currently no Android or Windows version, because those platforms aren&#39;t part of my development stack.</p>
<h3>Limits of AI</h3>
<p>AI is powerful, but not perfect. Sometimes it gets things wrong—especially with ambiguity, slang, rare meanings, or context that isn&#39;t fully specified. Treat AI output as a strong assistant, not an unquestionable authority: if something looks off, edit it, adjust the context, or regenerate with a clearer prompt.</p>

<h2>Start</h2>
<h3>Basic navigation</h3>
<p>The Start page is your home base. From here you can quickly jump into the core areas of Vokabulo—adding words, studying, and managing your vocabulary—without having to dig through menus.</p>
<h3>Date slider (streak and progress)</h3>
<p>At the top you&#39;ll find a date slider that lets you look back and forth across days. It&#39;s a simple way to understand your streak and your progress over time, and to get a quick feel for how consistent your learning has been.</p>
<h3>Language Pair containers</h3>
<p>The Start page also shows your language pair containers. These act as shortcuts so you can switch contexts quickly—especially if you learn more than one language or use different language directions. It&#39;s essentially another fast way to select a language pair and immediately see and study the vocabulary that belongs to it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Words</h2>
<p>Everything about adding, organizing, and managing your vocabulary.</p>
<h3>About Words</h3>
<p>The Words area is your personal vocabulary collection. It&#39;s where you add, edit, tag, search, and review everything you want to learn—so your learning stays organized instead of becoming a random list.</p>
<h3>Language pairs (and why order matters)</h3>
<p>A language pair defines the direction you&#39;re learning, for example <strong>DE → FR</strong> (German to French). The order matters because your cards, translations, and which side is treated as &quot;native&quot; vs &quot;target&quot; depend on it—DE–FR is not the same as FR–DE. For Community Sets, Vokabulo can display sets in both directions so you can use them regardless of which side you&#39;re starting from.</p>
<h3>Why context matters</h3>
<p>A word without context often doesn&#39;t mean much—or it means the wrong thing. That&#39;s why Vokabulo encourages learning vocabulary with a suitable context (a phrase or sentence). Context makes meaning clearer, improves recall, and helps you use the word correctly when you actually speak or write.</p>
<h3>Enter a new word (Magic Wand)</h3>
<p>To add a word, tap the plus button in the top right (available in almost every view, except during flashcards in Study). You can type into any of the fields, and you can even paste a full sentence. When you hit Translate, Vokabulo fills the other fields for you—best results come from only filling one field and letting the Magic Wand complete the rest.</p>
<h3>Edit words</h3>
<p>You can edit words anytime to improve translations, adjust context, fix spelling, or refine the meaning. Keeping entries clean pays off later during Study, because you&#39;ll review higher-quality cards.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>Use the pronunciation feature to hear how a word is spoken. Pronunciation can be fine‑tuned in settings, and Vokabulo uses high-quality ElevenLabs voices to make listening and repeating feel natural.</p>
<h3>Searching and duplicate detection</h3>
<p>Words can be searched quickly, and Vokabulo performs automatic duplicate detection to prevent your collection from filling up with the same word multiple times in slightly different forms.</p>
<h3>Bulk actions (select, tag, clear)</h3>
<p>When you want to manage many words at once, you can bulk select items, select all, or clear your current selection. Bulk editing lets you change tags efficiently—including removing tags, not just adding them.</p>
<h3>Suggest to Set</h3>
<p>If a word belongs in a Community Set, you can suggest it to the set. This helps improve shared sets while keeping your personal collection separate and flexible.</p>
<h3>Why tagging is key</h3>
<p>Tags are the fastest way to turn a big vocabulary list into a system. Tagging helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>find words later,</li>
<li>study by topic,</li>
<li>build sets, and</li>
<li>stay consistent when you&#39;re learning from real life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Default tags (especially for books and videos)</h3>
<p>You can set a default tag so every new word automatically lands in the right bucket—useful when you&#39;re reading a book, watching a series, or working through a theme and want to capture words quickly without extra steps.</p>
<h3>Filter by tags (single or multiple)</h3>
<p>You can filter your Words list by one or multiple tags. This makes it easy to review just the vocabulary you care about right now. You can clear all filters anytime.</p>
<h3>Tag management (long press)</h3>
<p>Long‑press a selected tag to manage it: you can rename it, create a set from it, or delete all words with this tag (useful for cleanup when a tag was temporary or imported by mistake).</p>
<h3>Sorting and review tabs</h3>
<p>To review your collection from different angles, you can switch sorting modes such as frequency or alphabetical, and use list modes like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newest/Latest</li>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Know least / know best</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can change the language pair directly in the add/edit dialog if you notice you&#39;re adding a word in the wrong direction.</li>
<li>Tagging improves everything: finding, filtering, studying, and building sets—start early, even with simple tags.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Study</h2>
<p>How spaced repetition works in Vokabulo and how to make steady progress.</p>
<h3>About Study</h3>
<p>Study is where your saved words turn into long-term memory. Vokabulo uses a spaced repetition system (SRS) to decide what you should review next and when—so you spend time on the words that need it most.</p>
<h3>The SRS system (and why it&#39;s not a quiz)</h3>
<p>Study is not a test, and it&#39;s not about &quot;winning.&quot; That&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t cheat by looking up the answer first. Vokabulo doesn&#39;t award points for being right in the moment—what matters is showing up consistently and keeping your reviews moving forward.</p>
<h3>The 5 levels</h3>
<p>Each word moves through five levels as you review it over time. Getting a word right pushes it forward to longer intervals; struggling with it brings it back sooner. This is how Vokabulo keeps easy words from wasting your time while still rescuing the ones you&#39;re about to forget.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>The key is consistency, not volume. A small daily session beats an occasional marathon. The goal is to keep your reviews sustainable so your vocabulary keeps growing without piling up.</p>
<h3>Study by number of cards or by minutes</h3>
<p>You can study in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By number of cards</strong> when you want a clear target (&quot;I&#39;ll do 30 cards&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>By minutes</strong> when you want a time-box (&quot;I&#39;ll study for 10 minutes&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filters: tags and levels</h3>
<p>You can narrow your session by tags (topic-based learning) or by levels (e.g., focus on newer or weaker words). This is useful when you want to prepare for a specific situation or clean up a backlog.</p>
<h3>Recent Filters</h3>
<p>Vokabulo remembers your last three filter selections so you can jump back into your usual study setup quickly. Clear all resets both your recent filters and any active tag filters. You can also deactivate a recent filter if you want to return to an unfiltered session.</p>
<h3>The Auto button (Study by Number)</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re not sure what to pick, Auto chooses a sensible card count for you—making it easy to start without overthinking.</p>
<h3>Reviewing cards: &quot;Got it&quot; and &quot;Not yet&quot;</h3>
<p>During Study you can swipe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Got it</strong> when you knew it well enough.</li>
<li><strong>Not yet</strong> when you didn&#39;t.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your choice updates the word&#39;s level and schedules the next review accordingly.</p>
<h3>Editing and deleting (during study/quiz)</h3>
<p>If a word is wrong, confusing, or no longer useful, you can edit it (to improve the translation/context) or delete it (to remove it from your learning queue). Keeping your collection clean improves your future sessions.</p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>Use the pronunciation feature to hear the word spoken. This is especially helpful for building listening confidence and avoiding &quot;silent vocabulary&quot; you can read but not recognize in real conversation.</p>
<h3>Display options</h3>
<p>You can adjust how cards are shown, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show native side first if you want recognition practice from your everyday language.</li>
<li>Show word instead of context if you want a more direct, vocabulary-first style of review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Points for Study</h3>
<p>Points are awarded for doing the work, not for being perfect. For every 10 cards reviewed, you get 1 point—regardless of whether you marked &quot;Got it&quot; or &quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>
<h3>Study reminders (and how to deactivate them)</h3>
<p>If you enable study reminders, Vokabulo nudges you to keep your routine. You can turn reminders off anytime in the app&#39;s settings/notifications preferences if you don&#39;t want prompts.</p>
<h3>Streaks: what they are and why they matter</h3>
<p>A streak counts how many days in a row you&#39;ve studied. It&#39;s important because streaks protect the habit—when motivation dips, the streak keeps you showing up for just a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Streak milestones</h3>
<p>Milestones celebrate consistency and give you a long-term rhythm to aim for. Even small sessions count—what matters is keeping the chain unbroken.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you feel overwhelmed, switch to minutes-based study and keep it small.</li>
<li>Use filters when you&#39;re preparing for something specific (travel, work, exam topics).</li>
<li>Keep your sets clean by editing/deleting entries that slow you down.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resetting learning progress</h3>
<p>If you want a fresh start, you can reset your learning progress for words so they return to earlier levels and are scheduled more frequently again. This is useful when you took a long break, changed your learning approach, or want to rebuild a foundation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Situations</h2>
<p>Generate focused vocabulary for real-life moments and learn what you need right now.</p>
<h3>About Situations</h3>
<p>Situations help you learn the right words for the moments that matter. You might speak confidently about your job, but feel like a beginner when you need vocabulary for the doctor, a date, small talk, or travel—Situations are built exactly for that gap.</p>
<h3>What is a Situation?</h3>
<p>A Situation is a short description of a real-life context where you want to express yourself better. Based on your briefing, Vokabulo generates a focused vocabulary list that matches what you&#39;re trying to say—so you don&#39;t just learn random words, but words you&#39;ll actually use.</p>
<h3>How to enter a Situation</h3>
<p>Write or dictate your Situation in natural language—just describe what&#39;s going on and what you want to be able to say. Vokabulo will automatically clean up your text if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Include a few details (who, where, topic, tone). There&#39;s a minimum length for the briefing, and generally: the better you describe the Situation, the better the vocabulary output.</p>
<h3>Proficiency level</h3>
<p>Choose your proficiency level so the generated words match where you are right now—whether you want safe, essential basics or more precise and advanced expressions.</p>
<h3>Generate vocabulary and saving</h3>
<p>When you generate, Vokabulo creates a set of around 25 words (the exact number depends on your briefing and how many relevant words the AI finds). You can then save the result to your collection and practice it like any other vocabulary set.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can run the same Situation multiple times with slightly different wording to discover new vocabulary or different angles.</li>
<li>Generation typically takes about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>If you like the result, you can turn your personal set into a community set so others can learn from it too.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>How Community Sets work and how you can contribute.</p>
<h3>About Community Sets</h3>
<p>Community Sets are shared vocabulary lists built by people who learn and use the language in real life. If you&#39;ve ever seen word lists or &quot;vocabulary packs&quot; in Facebook language groups, it&#39;s that idea—just structured, searchable, and designed to be practiced directly in Vokabulo. This makes getting started much easier, especially when you don&#39;t yet know what to learn next.</p>
<h3>Why Community Sets are different</h3>
<p>Community Sets are often more useful than textbooks because they can be tailored to everyday needs: your job, your hobbies, your city, your travel plans, or the situations you actually face. The goal is to create the best set of words for a specific topic in a specific language pair—focused, practical, and worth learning.</p>
<h3>A community effort (like Wikipedia)</h3>
<p>Each Community Set improves over time. People follow it, use it, and suggest better words, missing essentials, or clearer translations. Like Wikipedia, no single person has to get everything perfect—quality comes from many small improvements.</p>
<h3>The role of the Curator</h3>
<p>Every Community Set has a Curator who keeps it consistent and high-quality. Curators review suggestions, decide what fits the purpose of the set, and keep the vocabulary clean and coherent—so the set stays focused instead of becoming a random list.</p>
<h3>Your responsibility</h3>
<p>When you use Community Sets, you&#39;re benefiting from other learners&#39; work—so it helps to give something back. If you notice missing words, wrong translations, or better alternatives, you can suggest improvements and help make the set better for everyone.</p>
<h3>Follow and auto-download</h3>
<p>When you follow a Community Set, Vokabulo keeps it handy and can auto-download updates, so you always have the newest version without needing to search again.</p>
<h3>Suggest new words or edits</h3>
<p>You can contribute by suggesting new words, improved translations, or edits to existing entries. Your suggestions go to the Curator for review, helping the set steadily become more accurate, complete, and useful.</p>
